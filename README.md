# ElementaryProblem
- Prove the following simple positive series are convergent

\[
A = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^3 \cdot \sin^2(n)}
\]

Numerically it seems to be convergent to `30.3145`... but no one can prove this.

- Determine the convergence/divergence of the following simple positive series

\[
B = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2 \cdot \sin^2(n)}
\]
